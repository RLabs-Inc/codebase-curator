## Architecture and Contributions

### Adding Analysis Algorithms

If you're adding a new analysis algorithm:

1. Create the algorithm in `src/algorithms/`
2. Add types in `src/types/`
3. Update `AnalysisService` in `src/core/AnalysisService.ts`
4. Update the CLI presentation layer in `src/presentation/cli/app.ts`
5. Add tests
6. Update documentation

### Adding Language Support

For new language plugins:

1. Create plugin in `src/languages/plugins/{language}/`
2. Extend `BaseLanguageAnalyzer`
3. Register in `src/languages/index.ts`
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

### Service Layer Changes

When modifying core services (`src/core/`):

- Follow the service architecture pattern
- Keep presentation layers thin
