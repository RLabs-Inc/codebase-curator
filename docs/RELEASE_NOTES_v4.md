# Codebase Curator v4.0 - Multi-Language Revolution 🌐

## What's New

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support

Codebase Curator now understands **4 major programming languages**:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Full support including JSX/TSX
- **Python** - Classes, functions, decorators, docstrings  
- **Go** - Functions, types, interfaces, channels
- **Rust** - Structs, traits, impls, macros

### 🎯 Language-Aware Features

Each language extractor understands the unique patterns of its language:

#### Python
- Recognizes `@decorators` and magic methods like `__init__`
- Extracts docstrings as documentation
- Understands class inheritance and type hints
- Tracks async functions and dataclasses

#### Go
- Identifies receiver methods and interface implementations
- Tracks goroutines and channel operations
- Recognizes struct embedding
- Parses package-level declarations

#### Rust
- Understands trait implementations and derive macros
- Tracks ownership patterns and lifetimes
- Recognizes macro definitions and usage
- Parses module structure

### 🔍 Cross-Language Search

Smart Grep now searches seamlessly across all languages:

```bash
# Find all authenticate functions regardless of language
smartgrep "authenticate" --type function

# Search concept groups across languages
smartgrep group auth

# Language-specific searches
smartgrep "impl" --file "*.rs"    # Rust implementations
smartgrep "def" --file "*.py"     # Python functions
smartgrep "func" --file "*.go"    # Go functions
```

### 🛠️ Additional Improvements

1. **Human-Friendly Curator CLI**
   - Interactive chat mode for conversations
   - Memory management commands
   - Natural language syntax

2. **Professional Shell Completions**
   - Bash, Zsh, and Fish support for all tools
   - Context-aware suggestions
   - Man pages for each tool

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Live dashboard with code distribution
   - Real-time file change tracking
   - Architectural pattern detection

## Breaking Changes

None! All existing functionality remains intact.

## Migration Guide

Simply rebuild your semantic index to enable multi-language support:

```bash
smartgrep index
```

## What's Next

- More languages: Java, C#, Ruby, PHP
- Performance optimizations for large codebases
- Enhanced cross-reference analysis
- Language-specific concept groups
