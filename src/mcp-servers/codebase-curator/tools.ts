  overview: `üõ†Ô∏è AI-Optimized Tools Available in This Project:

1. **Smart Grep** - Semantic code search that understands your code
   Command: \`bun run smartgrep [pattern]\`
   
   ‚Ä¢ 10x faster than regular grep
   ‚Ä¢ Understands code structure (functions, classes, etc.)
   ‚Ä¢ Shows usage counts and cross-references
   ‚Ä¢ Supports concept groups (auth, api, error, etc.)
   
   Try: \`bun run smartgrep --help\` for full capabilities

2. **Incremental Monitor** - Real-time codebase insights
   Command: \`bun run monitor watch --overview\`
   
   ‚Ä¢ Live dashboard of code changes
   ‚Ä¢ Shows code distribution and complexity
   ‚Ä¢ Tracks unique files vs save events
   
üí° Tip: Consider adding frequently used commands to CLAUDE.md for future reference!`

  title: 'üö® IMPORTANT: Task Agents & Smartgrep Usage',
  
  discovery: `We discovered that Task agents have access to Bash and CAN use smartgrep, 
but they don't know about it unless you explicitly tell them!`,

  the_problem: `Task agents won't use smartgrep unless you specifically mention:
  1. That smartgrep exists
  2. How to run it (via Bash tool)
  3. Why it's better than regular grep`,

  best_practices: [
    '‚úÖ ALWAYS mention smartgrep explicitly in search-related Task prompts',
    '‚úÖ Include specific smartgrep command examples',
    '‚úÖ Explain that it\'s available via the Bash tool',
    '‚úÖ Mention it\'s semantic search, not just text matching'
  ],

  bad_example: {
    prompt: "Search for all authentication implementations in the codebase",
    problem: "Agent will likely use regular grep or Glob, missing semantic connections"
  },

  good_example: {
    prompt: `Search for all authentication implementations in the codebase. 
    
IMPORTANT: Use the Bash tool to run smartgrep for semantic search:
- 'bun run smartgrep group auth' - finds ALL auth patterns
- 'bun run smartgrep "authenticate" --type function' - finds auth functions
- 'bun run smartgrep refs "AuthService"' - finds all references

Smartgrep understands code structure and is much more effective than grep.`,
    benefit: "Agent now knows to use smartgrep and how to use it effectively!"
  },

  template: `When creating Task prompts for code searching, include:

"Use the Bash tool to run smartgrep commands for semantic code search:
- 'bun run smartgrep [pattern]' for literal searches
- 'bun run smartgrep group [concept]' for semantic pattern groups
- 'bun run smartgrep refs [term]' for cross-references
This is much more effective than regular grep as it understands code structure."`,

  reminder: 'üí° Task agents are powerful but need explicit guidance about available tools!'
