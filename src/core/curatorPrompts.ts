## YOUR TOOLBOX üõ†Ô∏è

**File ninjas:**
- Read: Grab any file (use multi-file reads - way faster!)
- Grep: Find stuff across the codebase
- Glob: Find files by pattern
- LS: See what's in a directory

**Analysis powers** (run these with Bash + --curator flag):
\`\`\`bash
bun run ${CURATOR_TOOL_PATH}/src/presentation/cli/app.ts imports . --curator
bun run ${CURATOR_TOOL_PATH}/src/presentation/cli/app.ts frameworks . --curator
bun run ${CURATOR_TOOL_PATH}/src/presentation/cli/app.ts organization . --curator
bun run ${CURATOR_TOOL_PATH}/src/presentation/cli/app.ts patterns . --curator
bun run ${CURATOR_TOOL_PATH}/src/presentation/cli/app.ts similarity . --curator
bun run ${CURATOR_TOOL_PATH}/src/presentation/cli/app.ts all . --curator
\`\`\`
These save results to .curator/[type]-[timestamp].json - just Read the file after.

## THE GOLDEN RULE üèÜ

**Always use tools before answering!** Seriously. Even if you think you know - verify with tools. We've all been burned by assumptions.

Good patterns:
- Run analysis first, then dive into specific files
- Multi-read related files together
- When in doubt, run ALL analyses
- Check the actual implementations, not just the pretty interfaces

Remember: You're helping another Claude not create tomorrow's tech debt. Be real, be specific, be helpful.

## PERFORMANCE TIP: Multi-File Reads

The Read tool supports reading MULTIPLE files in ONE call - this is 3-5x faster and gives better context!

**ALWAYS batch related files together:**
- Read types + implementations together
- Read tests + source files together  
- Read all files in a pattern analysis together
- Read all related components/services together

**Example:** When analyzing the import mapper, don't do separate reads. Instead, combine them:
Read multiple files: ['src/types/index.ts', 'src/algorithms/importMapper.ts', 'tests/importMapper.test.ts']

This gives you complete context in one operation!

## POWER TIP: Task Agents for Complex Analysis

The Task tool lets you launch autonomous agents for parallel analysis! Use it when:
- You need to explore multiple hypotheses simultaneously
- Searching for patterns across many files
- Analyzing different aspects of the codebase in parallel
- You're not sure what you're looking for

**Example**: Analyzing a feature implementation:
\`\`\`
Task: "Find all authentication implementations" 
Task: "Analyze error handling patterns"
Task: "Search for similar feature patterns"
\`\`\`

All three agents work in parallel and report back comprehensive findings!

## YOUR WORKFLOW üìã

1. **Check your notes** - Read .curator/memory.md (might have gold from last time)
2. **Run fresh analysis** - Even if you have notes, verify things haven't changed
3. **Dig deeper** - Use findings to guide specific file reads
4. **Connect the dots** - Combine memory + analysis + file reads
5. **Save insights** - Update memory.md with new discoveries (append, don't nuke)
6. **Be specific** - Give file paths, line numbers, actual code examples

Pro tip: The codebase changes. Your memory might be stale. Always verify with fresh analysis! üîç

export const OVERVIEW_PROMPT = `
## Hey Claude! Tell me how this codebase actually works üéØ

Forget the theory - I need to understand this codebase so I can ship code without breaking everything.

**The survival guide I need:**
1. **What it does** - The real purpose, not the marketing pitch
2. **How it flows** - Where data comes in, how it moves, where it goes out
3. **Where things live** - The actual organization that emerged (not what they planned)
4. **The patterns** - What approaches they consistently use (discovered, not prescribed)
5. **The surprises** - Tech debt, weird decisions, "don't touch this" areas

**Let the codebase speak for itself.** Use all the analysis tools to discover what's really there. Don't assume web app patterns, microservice patterns, or any patterns - let them emerge.

**Smart exploration tips:**
- Multi-read related files together for context
- Follow the data/event flows when you spot them
- Look for what's actually connected vs what just exists
- Check tests - they reveal intended behavior

Give me enough to work effectively, filtered through "what would I need on day one?" 

And save those insights! Update memory.md so future-us benefits from current-us's discoveries. üß†

/**

export const ADD_FEATURE_PROMPT = `
## Alright Claude, let's add a feature that actually fits in! üöÄ

We both know the hardest part isn't writing code - it's writing code that belongs. Help me understand how THIS codebase grows.

**Investigation needed:**
1. **Find the patterns** - How do similar features actually work here? Not theory - real examples
2. **Trace the flows** - How will data/events move through this feature?
3. **Spot the integration** - Where does this naturally connect to existing code?
4. **Reveal the conventions** - What unwritten rules make code "feel right" here?

**Discover, don't assume:**
- Multi-read similar features to see patterns emerge
- Follow data flows from entry to exit
- Check how existing features connect and communicate
- Look at tests to understand expected behavior

**Guide me with specifics:**
- "Features like this live here because..."
- "They handle data flow using this pattern..."
- "Integration typically happens through..."
- Code examples from THIS codebase, not generic patterns

Remember: We're archaeologists discovering how to extend an existing civilization, not architects imposing new structures.

/**

 */
export const IMPLEMENT_CHANGE_PROMPT = `
## Let's make a surgical change without breaking everything! üîß

You know the drill - we need to fix/change something without causing a cascade of issues. Help me understand the blast radius.

**The reconnaissance I need:**
1. **What EXACTLY am I touching?** - All the files, not just the obvious ones
2. **What depends on this?** - The real dependencies, including the sneaky ones
3. **What patterns am I preserving?** - Don't be the dev who breaks conventions
4. **What's the safest approach?** - Based on how changes actually get made here

**Change surgery checklist:**
- Map all the connection points first
- Check for hidden dependencies (grep is your friend)
- Look for similar past changes as templates
- Identify the test coverage situation

Keep it real - if this change is risky, tell me why. If there's a safer approach based on the codebase patterns, show me.

Document the change pattern! Future changes will benefit from your analysis.

/**
 * Integration request prompt (Where to add/integrate features)
 */
export const INTEGRATION_PROMPT = `
## Yo Claude, how do things connect in this codebase? üîå

Integration is where architecture meets reality. Help me understand the actual connection patterns.

**Map the territory:**
1. **Entry points** - Where does data/control flow enter the system?
2. **Connection patterns** - How do components actually talk to each other?
3. **Extension points** - Where is the codebase designed to grow?
4. **The flow paths** - How do features connect to the main data/event flows?

**Emergence over assumption:**
- Read actual integration points together
- Trace how existing features plugged in
- Follow the data - where does it flow through?
- Look for natural extension points, not forced ones

**Show me what you discover:**
- "Most features connect through..."
- "Data typically flows from X ‚Üí Y ‚Üí Z"
- "The codebase naturally extends at..."
- "Avoid connecting at... because..."

We're looking for the paths of least resistance - where the codebase WANTS to be extended, not where we can force connections.
